SINGLE LAYER PERCEPTRON:
- With perceptron learning the boundary is more near the datapoints that with delta learning. Furthermore, perceptron learning needs some more epochs to converge than delta learning. 
- Sequential learning always a little bit worst than batch learning (in terms of convergence speed).
- If the weights initialization is not optimal the algorithm need more number of epochs to converge. 

MULTIPLE LAYER PERCEPTRON:
- With 3 nodes in the hidden layer is enough to separate the data points.
- Not observe differences in the training and validating error between batch learning and sequential learning.
